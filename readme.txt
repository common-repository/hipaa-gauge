HIPAA Gauge checks for vulnerabilities that may hinder adherence to HIPAA compliance guidelines and identifies vulnerabilities within themes, plugins, and server settings. HIPAA guidelines are important to abide by, especially for healthcare organizations. Understanding HIPAA can be a daunting process, so HIPAA Gauge serves as an aid to owners of healthcare websites who are interested in seeing if their website adheres to HIPAA guidelines.

== Description ==
HIPAA Gauge reports vulnerabilities of plugins, themes, and the web server where the site is hosted. Vulnerabilities may impact the website's adherence to HIPAA compliance guidelines.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often are the reports updated with the latest vulnerabilities? =

The first report is produced shortly after the plugin is activated.  Report will be updated weekly for the normal version and daily for premium version.

= What extra features are included in the premium version? =

The premium version updates the vulnerability report daily instead of weekly.

The premium version also grants access to the latest vulnerability reports which includes details useful for remediating the vulnerabilities identified by the plugin.

= What is the cost of the premium version =

The premium version is free of any fee; however, we ask for a backlink in order to unlock the premium features. The backlink would be from the interior pages (not the home page) of your website to the HIPAA Gauge's URL.
